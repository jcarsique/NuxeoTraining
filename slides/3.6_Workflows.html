## Workflow concepts
</section>

<section class="slide" id="principles">
### Principles used 
#### Based on existing infrastructure and using existing features
- **Automation chains**: powered by Content Automation
- **Layouts**: dynamic forms using the layout system
- **Notifications**: using the freemarker templating system
- **Document**: stored as a structure of documents
</section>
    
<section class="slide" id="customization-process">
### Customization cycle
#### In Studio, we create the workflows
 - By designing the process using the graph
 - By configuring nodes (steps of the process) and their logic
  
#### In Nuxeo UI, we launch the workflows
 - Workflows are stored as templates at server start
 - Using one of these templates we start a workflow instance on a document.
 - Workflows can be started from the UI using “Workflow Process” widget or using the StartWorkflow operation.

####New Workflow Definition
- Template that will be used in DM to start workflows on documents
    
    - ID (must be unique) 
        - ID of the declared workflow template
        - Useful for starting a workflow with automation
    - Label
        - Displayed in Nuxeo in the drop down that launches a workflow
        - Supports i18n
    - Description
        - Displayed besides the dropdown list of available workflows, when the corresponding workflow is selected

     <section class="slide" id="workflow-var">
###Variables Tab
####Information that can be accessed during the workflow

- Stores data that comes from user forms or computed by automation chains
- Available for any workflow node using the predefined object WorkflowVariables[]
- *Similarly, we can define node variables available only for that specific node using the predefined object NodeVariables[]*

 <section class="slide" id="enablements">
### Availability Tab
#### Conditions for the workflow to be available
<img alt="workflow-availability" src="img/workflow-availability.png" class="float-right" />

- A workflow can be enabled according to
     - document types
     - the current lifecycle state
     - Permissions (ie. read/write right)
     - Facets
     - Path
     - etc.

<section class="slide" id="main-concepts">
### Graph main concepts

#### Graph  <img alt="workflow-graph-node" src="img/workflow-graph-node.png" class="float-right" /> 
- The graph is the definition of your process, it contains:
    - A start node
    - One or more end nodes
    - Any other type of node
    - Transitions 

#### Nodes
- A node is a step of your workflow
- Can be an automated node not requiring a user action, or a task assigned to one or several users
- Any node can also be a structural node.
- Can be added by drag and drop using the node library

#### Transitions
- Two nodes are linked by a transition
- A condition set on the transition filters the possibility to follow it
- A node can contain one or several transitions

### Practice - Start designing a workflow          
- Create a simple workflow having for id <code>newsValidationWorkflow</code> 
- Make sure this workflow can be started only on documents of type <code>Note</code>, and only if the user has the Read and Write permissions on the current document
- In the graph, drag and drop a <code>Start</code> and a <code>Stop</code> node using the node library
- Commit and deploy your changes
- In Nuxeo, check that your workflow model exists

###Node Configuration 

<img alt="Studio node edition form" class="float-right" src="img/workflow-node-general-tab.png" />

####General tab
- General information:  title, directive
- Input operation chain
    - The automation chain you specify here will be executed just before the workflow engine enters the node
- Output operation chain
    - The automation chain you specify here will be executed just before the workflow engine leaves the node, and follows the transition(s) if any.
- The documents following the workflow are set by the engine as the input documents when these chains are invoked. 
These chains are executed using an unrestricted session!
    
</section>
 

<section class="slide" id="node-variable">
###Node Configuration
####Variables tab
- Stores information that can be accessed in the context of the current node during the workflow
- Stores data that comes from user forms or computed by automation chains
- Available in the predefined object
    - <code>NodeVariables["nodeVariableName"]</code>
- A predefined variable called “assignees” exists on every task node
    - Used by <code>Compute Additional Assignees = NodeVariables["assignees"]</code>
- Node variables are available:
    - In the task layouts
    - In the email notification templates
</section>
    
<section class="slide" id="Transition">
###Node Configuration
####Transition Tab
    
- For every transition : an endpoint with the name of the transition, from which you will be able to pull the arrow to connect nodes
- Transition
    - name: only displayed in the graph, and used internally by the engine
    - Condition: condition the workflow engine evaluates in order to know which are the next nodes to be executed after the current one is done.
    - Chain: The automation chain will be executed when the workflow engine goes into this transition
    
<img alt="workflow-transition-arrow" src="img/workflow-transition-arrow.png"/>
 </section>

    
<section class="slide" id="Transition-condition">
###Node Configuration
####Condition
- Condition the workflow engine evaluates in order to know which are the next nodes to be executed after the current one is done.
    - default value for the condition is “true”
    - all the transitions having the corresponding condition evaluated to “true” are executed
    - you have access at all the workflow context variables ( including Node and Workflow variables)
    - the default condition related to a task button is 
<code>NodeVariables["button"] == ”idOfTheClickedBtn”</code>
- Fork
    - Ex. Two transitions having the condition evaluated to “true” = Fork two branches
- Conditional nodes 
    - Ex. On a node having two transitions, the conditions could be :
<code>WorkflowVariables["status"] == "done"</code> and <code>WorkflowVariables["status"] != "done" </code>

###Exercise: Nodes and transitions
First we will create an empty workflow

- Create a simple workflow having only the Start and the Stop nodes (mandatory nodes)
- Make sure this workflow can be started only on documents of type `Book` and only if the user has the Read and Write permissions on the current document
- After deploying the workflow in Nuxeo go to the Workflow tab in Admin Center and check that your workflow model is there
- Start the workflow from a `Book` document, the workflow should do nothing
- Add a new node that
  - call an automation chain publishing the document in a existing section `/default-domain/sections/section1`

- Assignees
    - You can add here static assignees, either users or groups, one per input field (click on "add" to add more than one)
    - You can  prefix users by "user:" like user:jack and groups by "group:" like group:validators.
- Compute additional assignees
    - You can set here a scripted expression (MVEL syntax) so as to determine how the assignees on that task will be computed at runtime
    - You have access to some useful variables in the context, like the WorkflowVariables, NodeVariables, Current User and others

#### General tab: Notifications 
- Mail Notifications
      - Specify here the mail template that is going to be used for generating the mail to be sent to the task assignees
      - if no template is selected, the task assignees are not notified
      - Custom variables <div class="further-info">can be used in a mail template in this specific case</div>
<pre><code>
${workflowStartTime}

<section class="slide" id="task-config-form">
###Task Configuration
####Form tab

- Form layout
    <img alt="workflow-task-form" src="img/workflow-task-form.png" class="float-right" />
    - Configure the form that will be displayed to the user for processing the task
    - Specify which fields have to fill
    - Layout edition works as usual
        - pickup the fields on the right
        - Choose between system properties, workflow variables and node variables. 
        - If you need the user to set/see some workflow or node variables 
            - just drag and drop them on the form
            - the engine will automatically save them when the form is submitted 
            - you can use them later
</section>
 <section class="slide" id="task-config-buttons">
###Task Configuration
####Form tab: Buttons
     
- Configures the buttons to be displayed for submitting the task form
- Buttons can be linked to transitions with <code>NodeVariable["Button"] == "buttonId"</code> 
     
<img alt="workflow-task-form" src="img/workflow-task-buttons.png" class="float-center" />

- Id
    - stored in the  built-in NodeVariable called "button" 
    - can be used for instance to express conditions for knowing which transition the workflow engine should follow after the current node is done
- Label of the button (supports i18n)
- Filter
    - Filter to hide or display the button on some conditions
    - Work only starting from 5.7. (an action filter)
- Generates the condition for transition 
    - checked by default when you add a line
    - helper so that a transition corresponding to the button is automatically declared on the Transitions tab

<section class="slide exercise" id="exercise-simple-task">
<img src="nuxeo-slide-template/themes/exercise.svg" alt="exercise"
      class="exercise-icon">
###Exercise: Simple task
Create a simple workflow to validate the publishing of a document by Administrator

- the document will be published at a predefined existing location ( manually go and create a section called *Public* in Sections, having the path `/default-domain/sections/Published`)
- this workflow should be available only on the documents of type `Book`
- the Administrator can either validate or reject the publication
(use the predefined `Accept/Reject` task)
- the due date displayed for the Administrator should be the current date.

<section class="slide" id="variables">
Workflow Variables
---------------------------------
</section>
<section class="slide" id="workflow-variables">
###Variables in workflows
    
####2 types of variables
- Node variables
    - Defined on a node and accessible on the node scope

- Workflow variables
    - Defined at workflow level, accessible from any node
    - Shared within the whole instance of the workflow
    - Available in the automation context <code>WorkflowVariables["wfVariableName"]</code>
    - Can be used in the *Compute additional assignees* of a task
    - Accessible in the task layouts
    - Available from notification templates
    - Have a type: string, float, blob etc.
    - Can be a date picked up in a calendar, a file, a constrained value etc.
    
</section>


<section class="slide" id="built-variables">
###Built-in Variables
####Available in

- chains launched within the nodes (Input chain, output chain, transition chains)  
- the condition of a transition
- additional task assignees (if the expression is resolved to a user or group)
- due date expression (if the expression is resolved to a date)

####List of built-in variables
- *WorkflowVariables* and *NodeVariables*  (hashmaps), used like this: NodeVariables[“myNodeVar”]
- *workflowInitiator*
- *workflowStartTime* 
    - Time when the workflow was started
    - useful for exemple when computing a due date (Due date expression: workflowStartTime.days(8))
- *Documents/document* documents bound to the workflow
    - Those documents are also set as input of chains executed.
- *button* button id that was clicked for processing the task, if the current node is a task node
- *nodeId*
- *nodeStartTime* Time the node was started, useful for exemple when computing a due date (Due date expression: nodeStartTime.days(8))
- *nodeEndTime*
- *nodeLastActor* Last actor on the node. Useful for instance to know who closed a task when the task was assigned to a group
- http://doc.nuxeo.com/x/EQGw
 </section>
    
<section class="slide" id="assignees">
###Task Assignment
#### To a computed variable
- Use input chain to set a Node variable
- Leverage vocabulary tables to provide a quick mapping interface between some users and some others (Jack is John's manager)
    
#### To the workflow initiator
- *workflowInitiator* variable
- See also *nodeLastActor*
    
####To a static user/group
- See "group:…" or "user:..."notation 
- Ex: assignment to hr_manager group in the workflow

</section>

            
<section class="slide" id="set-workflow">
###How to set workflow and node variables
####From the task form
- The engine will automatically save them when the form is submitted 
    
####From automation chains
- Using *Workflow Context > Set Workflow Variable* <code>SetWorkflowVar</code> and *Set Node Var* <code>SetNodeVar</code> operations
- For instance when the task form should display some pre-initialized variables
    
    ![A task form with a preinitialized field](img/workflow-preinit-var.png)

###Exercise: Task Form, Variables
Let's now create a more complicated workflow to validate the publication of a document.
We want to publish a document at a chosen location,
but the publication must be validated by a chosen user (validator) in order to occur.
If user reject the publication, the workflow initiator can choose another validator or cancel its request

- This workflow should be available only on the documents of type `Book` and only if the current user is a member of *administrators* group
- The first task of the workflow is assigned to the user who started the workflow.
  - This user has to choose here the validator and where he wants to publish the doc. use the widget `Single user suggestion`
  - Use `Single Document Suggestion` widget type  to choose the section, use the page provider `default_section_suggestion`
- The chosen validator can approve the publication or reject ( use an  approve/reject task). ( in serial way) .
  They both need to submit a *comment* when approving or rejecting the task ( mandatory).
  They both need temporary access to the document being published ( assuming that they don't necessarily have them ).
  Also he need to know where the doc will be published ( but this info must be displayed in Read only).
  - notify the validator when a task was assigned to him ( only if you have a mail server configured ) 
  - for the comment, use a NodeVariable called *comment*

##Advanced concepts and usage
</section>

 <section class="slide" id="Storage-infos">
###How does Nuxeo stores Workflows ?
- Workflow models and instances are stored as documents of type DocumentRoute 
- default path for workflow models: /document-route-models-root/
     - default path for workflow instances : example
/default-domain/document-route-instances-root/2012/12/12
- Workflow nodes are stored as documents of type RouteNode
     - default path for workflow nodes: example:
/document-route-models-root/SerialDocumentReview/  
- Tasks are stored as documents of type TaskDoc  
     - default path for tasks docs: /tasks-root/
- Type of task document used by the workflow is configurable in Studio 
- Each workflow step history is stored in Audit
</section> 
    
<section class="slide" id="chains">
###Where can I plug Automation chains ?

- Attached to each transition
- Attached to node input and output
- The input documents are the documents bound to the workflow
- Available with the variable *Documents*
- Transition chains executed before output chains
<blockquote>These chains are executed using an unrestricted session!!</blockquote>
